I created two tables. My first table was titled employee and it contained employee_id, employee_name, and role. The primary key was employee_id. The second table was titled hospital_department and it incorporated department_id, department_name, and department_head, and the foreign key was department_head which was connected to employee_id. the primary key was department_id.
